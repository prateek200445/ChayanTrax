# 🛰️ ChayanTrax – Smart Change Detection over Satellite AOIs

**ChayanTrax** is a scalable, AI-powered platform for detecting and alerting significant changes in satellite imagery over **user-defined Areas of Interest (AOIs)** using multi-temporal data from **Bhoonidhi** (Red, Green, NIR bands). Built for non-technical users, it offers real-time notifications, GIS-ready exports, and advanced ML-based differentiation between natural and human-driven changes.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **AOI Selection (Chayan)**  
  Draw, upload, or define AOIs on an interactive WebGIS map.

- ☁️ **Cloud & Shadow Masking**  
  Accurate pre-processing using **Python Fmask** or AI segmentation.

- 🔁 **Change Tracking (Trax)**  
  Spectral differencing + ML classification to detect real changes while avoiding seasonal or atmospheric noise.

- ⚡ **Real-Time Alerts**  
  Stay informed with email or in-app alerts for detected changes.

- 📂 **GIS-Compatible Output**  
  Export results in Shapefile, GeoTIFF, or GeoJSON formats.

- 📱 **No-Code Interface**  
  Designed for planners, NGOs, and city officials – no tech skills required.
